### One Semester into my master's in cognitive science

***

After the first semester into my master's in cognitive science at the University of TÃ¼bingen, one thing is for sure:
In my [previous post](% post_url /_post/2019-09-21-wind-of-change  %) I was right about my feeling that "_it's not going to be a walk in the park_"
to make the transition from psychology to cognitive science.

***

In the first semester I concentrated on completing the _obligatory_ courses/modules of my curriculum, which include:
+ **Methods in Neuropsychology**: essentially an introduction to the various methods used to infer causal relationships between specific cognitive functions/abilities
and underling brain areas (with a focus on _voxel-based lesion-behavior mapping_).
+ **Evolution of Cognition**: an introductory course covering the main theories of how the cognitive abilities (which are claimed by some researchers to be specific for the species Homo sapiens) such as: speech, language, (large-scale) cooperation with non-kin, altruism, altruistic punishment to enforce social norms in groups and social learning.
+ **Informatik I**: an introductory programming class using the didactic, [Lisp](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp) - based programming language [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/). The course was based on the book [How to design programs (2nd ed.)](https://htdp.org/), by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, Shriram Krishnamurthi.
+ **Algorithms**: an introductory course to algorithms and data structures based on the infamous book [Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein.

Of these courses by far the most challenging one for me was **Algorithms**.

My bachelor's degree in psychology covered three consecutive statistics courses which I actually enjoyed, but they unfortunately did not prepare
me for the math that is required to solve recurrences and prove running times of algorithms. At the beginning of the course I honestly was so overwhelmed
that I started to have doubts whether I would be able to pass it.

However, after some weeks into the course I realized that it was actually not the math itself
but primarily the '**algorithmic way of thinking**' which was challenging. If you are not used to thinking in '_indices_', '_recurrences_', '_invariants_' , '_trees_', '_adjacency lists_' or '_for_' - and '_while - loops_' it will get some time getting used to it.

**Actually, that should have been no surprise when you walk into a course that is intended for 5th-semester computer science students, without no/little prior programming experience.**

Following the lectures was quite difficult. Most of the time it took me longer to make sense of the algorithms that were presented in _pseudocode_ than the time they were actually displayed. So I was pretty much constantly trying to follow lectures with a time lag of 3 - 5 minutes (quite challenging for your working memory I can tell you).
In addition the course included weekly group assignments which (according to the professor) were intended to take up to 15 hours to solve completely. Most likely that estimate was also made for computer science students, because me and my other group member (also no computer-science background) took more like 20 hours.

**But now enough with the whining!**

In the end I have to admit that I liked - and even enjoyed - the course!

Besides the fact that it was quite challenging for me, it gave a good introduction to the '_algorithmic way of thinking_', which I am sure will be useful going forward in my studies and beyond. Furthermore, the course made me realize how complex and challenging it is to develop efficient algorithms. After taking the course I have even more admiration for the field of computer science in general and particularly for the people who have the ability to design new efficient algorithms!
