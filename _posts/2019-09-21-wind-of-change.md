### Making the transition from a bachelor's in psychology to a master's in cognitive science

It's definitely not going to be a walk in the park and (for me and most others) it requires primarily two things: catching up the math and learning how to code.

***
## Some background

The field of cognitive science started out as a scientific endeavor to study '_the mind_' in an interdisciplinary fashion, the main contributing fields being: psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence/computer science, linguistics, anthropology and philosophy [Fig. 1].

Due to it's inherently interdisciplinary fashion many different working definitions of cognitive science have been put forward since the advent of the field. For a matter of fact, many scholars tend to disagree with earlier definitions and/or definitions put forward by others. Nevertheless, there seems to exist a consensus on some of the fields' '_core features_' as Núñez et al. put it in their paper (2019):

> "[...] beyond	the	diversity
> of	definitions	that	have	been	offered	over	the	years,	what	can	be	retained	is	that
> cognitive	science	has	had	a	strong	commitment	with	the	notion	of	“mental
> representation”	and	with	the	constitutive	role	played	by	the	computer	(and
> computation)	in	the	development	of	the	field’s	body	of	knowledge."

Furthermore, they quote Valera, Thompson and Rosch (1991), who state that:

> "[...] an	important	pole	is	occupied	by	artificial intelligence —thus	the	computer	model	of	the	mind	is	a	dominant	aspect	of	the	entire field."

And Bechtel and Graham (1998), who say that:

> "Cognitive	science	holds	general	“assumptions	that	the	mind	is	(1)	an	information	processing	system,	(2)	a	representational	device,	and	(3)	(in	some	sense)	a	computer."

## Does the 'Cognitive Science Hexagon' still stand strong today?

To investigate the '_true state_' of cognitive science as an interdisciplinary discipline, Núñez et al. (2019) looked at different bibliometric and socio-institutional indicators:

[Fig. 2] _Results of the analysis of indicators (adopted from Núñez et al. (2019) )_

### Authors' affiliations in Cognitive science

Núñez et al. (2019) analyzed 1020 research articles and commentaries published after the year 2000 in the journal [Cognitive Scinece](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cognitive-science-journal/) to find out the relative representation of the main contributing disciplines by author's affiliations.
They found that authors affiliated to psychology by far make up the majority (63.1%) and are therefore highly overrepresented relative to the other contributing fields. Interestingly, computer science with 8.5% of author's affiliations and neuroscience with 7% of author's affiliations are still largely underrepresented. To me personally, this is a very unexpected result, given the rapid development of both fields in the last few decades. In contrast to this, the number of authors affiliated to anthropology (1%) and the number of authors affiliated to philosophy (3%) shows that these two fields are virtually not represented in the journal [Fig. 2A]

### "Scientometrics"

In addition Núñez et al. (2019) performed a quantitative analysis of the citation patterns of the journal [Cognitive Scinece](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cognitive-science-journal/) and observed a quite similar pattern to the one which emerged from the analysis of authors' affiliations.
Again, Núñez et al. (2019) found a large relative overrepresentation of psychology with the highest volume of citations (65.7%) going to and being received from this field. Psychology is followed by neuroscience with roughly 20% of citations. Th remaining volume of citations is completely taken up by the field of linguistics, as anthropology and philosophy are not represented at all [Fig. 2B].

### PhD training of cognitive science's faculty members

The PhD background of cognitive science's faculty members shows a slightly different picture as compared to the first two indicators. The data are based on publicly available educational histories of active faculty members in	the	four	cognitive science departments	that	grant	a	Ph.D.	degree:	Johns
Hopkins	University	(JHU),	Renssaeler	Polytechnic	Institute	(RPI),	the	University	of California,	San	Diego	(UCSD),	and	the	Central	European	University	in	Budapest	(CEU) (State 2018) [Fig. 2C].

Núñez et al. (2019) write:

> "The	most	consistent	feature across	departments	is	the	overrepresentation	of	faculty	members with	training	in	psychology and	the	complete	lack	of	faculty members	with	a	background	in	anthropology.	Moreover,	the distribution	of	faculty	members with	backgrounds	in	neuroscience,	linguistics	and	computer science vary	drastically	across	the	departments	with	each	constituting	as	little	as	0%	in one	department	and	more	than	20%	in	another."

## What does this all mean for people who strive to make the transition to cognitive science from one of its core disciplines (in my case psychology)?

I guess it mostly depends on the field/discipline that you are starting out from.
Given the statistics provided in the paper by Núñez et al. (2019), one could assume that having a background in psychology (especially cognitive psychology or even cognitive neuroscience) is a pretty good starting point to make the transition into the field of cognitive science, and in principle I agree with that. I am very lucky to have completed my bachelor's degree in psychology at the [Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-psychology-and-neuroscience) of Maastricht University, which has a strong focus on cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience.

However, based on my personal experience of searching through and comparing curricula of different universities/institutions that offer a (master's) degree in cognitive science, I tend to disagree with the relatively '_weak_' contributions of artificial intelligence/computer science and neuroscience (as put forward by Núñez et al., 2019). __On the contrary, I have gained the impression that especially the disciplines artificial inteligence/computer science and neuroscience have become - and still are becoming - more and more important contributors to the field of cognitive science, even to the point that they catch up with the importance of psychology__ (based on the statistics by Núñez et al., 2019).

This impression of mine is mainly based on the fact, that most of the curricula I have come across (master's program in my case) require every applicant to have achieved a certain amount of credits/ECTS in the fields of mathematics (mainly statistics, calculus and linear algebra) as well as in the field of computer science (mainly programming and algorithms & data structures). Mostly, these requirements are justified by the fact that (besides the 'lower-level' statistical concepts that are necessary for empirical science) the mathematical knowledge and computer science knowledge is needed to be able to cope with the 'higher-level' concepts such as statistical modeling, cognitive modeling and machine learning. In contrast, students coming from a computer science or mathematics background are not necessarily required to prove credits/ECTS from the fields of psychology and neuroscience. To me, this imbalance with regard to the pre-requirements of the majority of master's programs already highlights the importance that mathematics and artificial intelligence/computer science have for the field of cognitive science (in contrast to the statistics provided by Núñez et al., 2019).

Another critical factor are pre-requirements for individual courses which you will necessarily have to deal with, even if you have been admitted to a cognitive science program without a strong background in mathematics and/or artificial intelligence/computer science. For a lot of the advanced courses in statistics and artificial intelligence (machine learning) you will almost inevitably be confronted with programming, be it in `R`, `python`, `Matlab/Octave` or even `C`. Furthermore, you will be confronted with a lot of math to understand what your code is actually doing.

__So buckle up, fellas. It's goin' to be a bumpy ride.__ (At least for those who are relatively new to programming and advanced math)

## Wait, that's it?

No.
Luckily, many of the universities/institutions that offer a (master's) program in cognitive science have realized that not all students making the transition form one of the core disciplines besides computer science (e.g. neuroscience or psychology) come equipped with the necessary math and programming skills. Therefore, they have developed strategies to deal with this situation. Of course these strategies differ between institutions and countries and in this post I will only be able to provide information about Germany and the Netherlands.   

__In the Netherlands__, most universities offer a so-called 'Pre-Master program' for aspiring master's students who find themselves in the position of only partly fulfilling the requirements for direct admission. [Here](https://www.rug.nl/feb/education/study-programmes/pre-msc/) is an example from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands.

> "Pre-master programmes are designed to help you enter one of FEB's Master programmes when you have certain deficiencies in your academic background. Once you have successfully completed the pre-Master, you can enroll in the corresponding Master's programme."

These Pre-Master programs are usually tailored to your individual 'deficiencies' (I really dislike this word) based on your prior academic background. A Pre-Master program can have a maximum load of 60 credits/ECTS (that's the '_worst case_', usually it'll be way less) and it will mostly consist of Bachelor's courses from the respective field of study. The downside of Pre-master programs is that you are required to complete all of the courses within one year before you are allowed to start off with the 'regular' master's program. If you are required to complete the maximum course load of 60 credits/ECTS, you will most likely need the whole year. However, if your Pre-master program only consists of two or three courses, you will usually have to wait until the 'regular' master's program starts again. Depending on (1) how fast you are able to complete your courses and (2) whether the 'regular' master's program starts in winter semester or summer semester, this means that you may lose half a year or even more.

__In Germany__, things are being handled a little bit different. Instead of having to complete a Pre-master program _before_ the start of the 'regular' master's program, you are able to start directly with the 'regular' master's program. Nevertheless, you are required to take additional courses to catch up on the knowledge you are lacking. While the amount of additional courses you will have to take is usually fixed, the kind of additional courses you are required to take will depend on your academic background.

[Here](https://uni-tuebingen.de/index.php?eID=tx_securedownloads&p=147678&u=0&g=0&t=1583666555&hash=ed07ff5b445aaa5a719bd90d8e108237cb2a751a&file=/fileadmin/Uni_Tuebingen/Fakultaeten/InfoKogni/WSI/Dokumente/Studium/Download/Modulhandbuecher/MHB_Kognitionswissenschaft_MSc_2019_11_28.pdf) is an example from the master's program in cognitive science at the University of Tübingen, Germany. The document is written in German so I will translate the important bits. On page four under the section 'organization of the program'  the document states:

> "Students holding a bachelor's degree in computer science, biology, psychology or linguistics are required to complete '_lateral entry_' courses (18 credits/ECTS) in addition to their compulsory courses (36 credits/ECTS)."

The document further states:

> "Students making the transition form the fields of biology, psychology or linguistics are required to take the additional courses 'informatics I' or 'informatics II' (9 credits/ECTS, respectively) and the courses 'algorithms' or 'theoretical informatics' (9 credits/ECTS, respectively). Students making the transition form the field of informatics (computer science) are required to take the additional courses 'cognitive science A' and 'B' (9 credits/ECTS, respectively) and either 'cognitive psychology B' or 'C' (9 credits/ECTS, respectively)."

Additionally to these '_core requirements_' for aspiring master's students of those different academic backgrounds, you are encouraged by the University of Tübingen to take bachelor's courses in statistics and mathematics to get your knowledge up to date.

Personally, I really like the approach taken by the University of Tübingen, which is a major argument why I have chosen to enroll in this universities' master's program. I am confident that the approach taken by the University of Tübingen provides an optimal scaffolding for me to make the transition into the field of cognitive science, given my academic background in psychology and neuroscience. However, until now this is all just theory. I'm looking forward to see how it all turns out in practice.
