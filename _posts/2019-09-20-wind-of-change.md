### Making the transition from a bachelor's in psychology to a master's in cognitive science

It's definitely not going to be a walk in the park and (for me and most others) requires primarily two things: catching up the math and learning how to write code.

***
## Some background

The field of cognitive science started out as a scientific endeavor to study '_the mind_' in an interdisciplinary fashion, the main contributing fields being: psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence (primarily computer science), linguistics, anthropology and philosophy [Fig. 1].

Due to it's inherently interdisciplinary fashion many different working definitions of cognitive science have been put forward since the advent of the field. For a matter of fact, many scholars tend to disagree with earlier definitions and/or definitions put forward by others. Nevertheless, there seems to exist a consensus on some of the fields core features as Núñez et al. put it in their paper (2019):

> "[...] beyond	the	diversity
> of	definitions	that	have	been	offered	over	the	years,	what	can	be	retained	is	that
> cognitive	science	has	had	a	strong	commitment	with	the	notion	of	“mental
> representation”	and	with	the	constitutive	role	played	by	the	computer	(and
> computation)	in	the	development	of	the	field’s	body	of	knowledge. These	elements
> have	constituted	a	central	component	of	what	philosopher	of	science	Imre	Lakatos
> called	the	“hard	core”	of	a	field’s	research	program —basic	tenets	and	conjectures	that
> are	not	meant	to	be	challenged	or	refuted	if	the	research	program	is	to	be	successful."

Furthermore, they quote Valera, Thompson and Rosch (1991) who state that:

> "[...] an	important	pole	is	occupied	by	artificial intelligence —thus	the	computer	model	of	the	mind	is	a	dominant	aspect	of	the	entire field."

And Bechtel and Graham (1998) who say that:

> "Cognitive	science	holds	general	“assumptions	that	the	mind	is	(1)	an	information	processing	system,	(2)	a	representational	device,	and	(3)	(in	some	sense)	a	computer."

### To investigate the '_true state_' of cognitive science as as discipline, Núñez et al. looked at different bibliometric and socio-institutional indicators (2019):

[Fig. 2] _Results of the analysis of indicators (adopted from Núñez et al. (2019) )_

### Authors' affiliations in Cognitive science

Núñez et al. (2019) analyzed 1020 research articles and commentaries published after 2000 in the journal [Cognitive Scinece](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cognitive-science-journal/) to find out the relative representation of the main contributing disciplines by author's affiliations.
They found that authors with psychology affiliation by far make up the majority (63.1%) and are therefore highly overrepresented relative to the other contributing fields. Interestingly, computer science with 8.5% of author's affiliations and neuroscience with 7% of author's affiliations are still largely underrepresented. To me personally, this is a very unexpected result, given the rapid development of both fields in the last two decades. In contrast to this, the number of authors affiliated to anthropology (1%) and the number of authors affiliated to philosophy (3%) shows that these two fields are virtually not represented in the journal [Fig. 2]

### "Scientometrics"

In addition Núñez et al. (2019) performed a quantitative analysis of the citation patterns of the journal [Cognitive Scinece](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cognitive-science-journal/) and observed a quite similar pattern to the on which emerged from the analysis of authors' affiliations.
Again, Núñez et al. (2019) found a large relative overrepresentation of psychology with the highest volume of citations (65.7%) going to and being received from this field, followed by neuroscience with ~20%. Th remaining volume of citations is completely taken up by the field of linguistics, as anthropology and philosophy are not represented at all [Fig. 2].

### PhD training of cognitive science's faculty members

The PhD background of cognitive science's faculty members shows a slightly different picture as compared to the first two indicators stated above. The data are based on publicly available educational histories of active faculty members in	the	four	departments	of	cognitive	science	that	grant	a	Ph.D.	degree:	Johns
Hopkins	University	(JHU),	Renssaeler	Polytechnic	Institute	(RPI),	the	University	of California,	San	Diego	(UCSD),	and	the	Central	European	University	in	Budapest	(CEU) (State 2018) [Fig. 2].

Núñez et al. (2019) write:

> "The	most	consistent	feature
across	departments	is	the	overrepresentation	of	faculty	members with	training	in	psychology
and	the	complete	lack	of	faculty	with	a	background	in	anthropology.	Moreover,	the
distribution	of	faculty	members with	backgrounds	in	neuroscience,	linguistics	and	computer
science	__vary	drastically	across	the	departments	with	each	constituting	as	little	as	0%	in
one	department	and	more	than	20%	in	another__."

## What does this all mean for people who strive to make the transition to cognitive science from one of its core disciplines (in my case psychology)?

I guess it mostly depends on the field/discipline that you are starting out from.
Given the statistics provided in the paper by Núñez et al. (2019), one could tell that having a background in psychology (especially cognitive psychology or even cognitive neuroscience) is a pretty good starting point to make the transition into the field of cognitive science and in principle I agree with that. I am very lucky to have completed my bachelor's degree in psychology at the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience of Maastricht University, which has a strong focus on cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience.

However, based on my personal experience of looking up and comparing curricula of different universities/institutions that offer a (master's) degree in cognitive science, I tend to disagree with the relatively '_weak_' contributions of artificial intelligence/computer science and neuroscience ( based on the statistics provided by Núñez et al., 2019). __On the contrary, I have gained the impression that especially the disciplines artificial inteligence/computer science and neuroscience have become (and still are becoming) more and more important contributors to the field of cognitive science, even to the point that they catch up with the importance of (cognitive) psychology (based on the statistics by Núñez et al., 2019).__

This impression of mine is mainly based on the fact, that most of the curricula I have looked up (master's programs in my case) require every applicant to have achieved a certain amount of credits/ECTS in the fields of mathematics (mainly statistics, calculus and linear algebra) as well as in the field of computer science (mainly programming and algorithms & data structures). Mostly, these requirements are justified by the fact that, besides the statistical concepts that are necessary for any empirical science, the mathematical knowledge and computer science knowledge is needed to be able to cope with the 'higher-level' concepts such as statictical modeling, cognitive modeling and machine learning.

In contrast, students coming from a computer science or mathematics background are not necessarily required to prove credits/ECTS from the fields of psychology and neuroscience. To me, this imbalance with regard to the pre-requirements of the majority of master's programs already highlights the current importance that mathematics and artificial intelligence/computer science have in the field of cognitive science (in contrast to the statistics provided by Núñez et al., 2019).
