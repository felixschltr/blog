### My resources for my algorithms class

As you may already guess, most of the summaries/examples will be based on the book [Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein. Partly, they will also be based on the slides provided by my professor which, however, are also mostly based on the book.

I will update the collection of summaries/examples on this page as I progress through the content of the course (while studying for the exam).

Most of the summaries/examples will be static websites created with [CodiMD](https://md.kif.rocks/), a platform to create Markdown notes.
I currently use CodiMD a lot, as it is (still) free, supports LaTeX (+ many other features) and offers an option to download your Markdown note as a pretty-nice-looking HTML file.
