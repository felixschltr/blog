__"Tactile acuity and visuo-tactile multisensory integration in the context of deafness"__

This is the title of my Bachelor's thesis which I handed in in May 2019 as part of my Bachelor's program in psychology at Maastricht University.

It is an empirical thesis on which I worked primarily during my exchange semester at the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) (UdeM), Canada. At UdeM I had the opportunity to join an ongoing research project at the [Centre de recherche en neuropsychologie et cognition](http://www.cernec.umontreal.ca/Index_f.htm) (CERNEC) under the supervision of Emma Campbell (Phd student) and [Franco Lepore, Phd](https://psy.umontreal.ca/repertoire-departement/vue/lepore-franco/), who is the director of CERNEC. Through joining the doctoral research project of Emma, I was able to gather the data on which my final Bachelor's thesis is based.

At the time Emma was at the beginning of her doctoral research project on changes in tactile acuity and multisensory integration in congenitally deaf persons before and after undergoing cochlear implant surgery. Using behavioral tasks in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Emma wanted to track changes on both a behavioral and neurophysiological level. This was an endeavor which had previously attracted only little attention in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Nevertheless,  Emmas' findings could help to predict how well a particular deaf patient (who is planning on undergoing cochlear implant surgery) will cope with the cochlear implant. In other words: Emmas' data would help to predict how well the cochlear implant will be received by a particular patient, based on his prior neurophysiological state. Once I heard about Emmas' project, I was intrigued by the topic and decided to join her as a research assistant.
