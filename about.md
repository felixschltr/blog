## About me

![img_01.png ><](/blog/assets/images/img_01.png)

I am a Master's student of cognitive science at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) who is passionate about unraveling and understanding the workings of the human brain. I chose to enroll in the Master's program in cognitive science due to my interest in the computational approach to human cognition and human intelligence which has developed during my Bachelor's program in psychology. I am fascinated by the way in which concepts from computer science (especially machine learning) can be used to create and evaluate new, more accurate models of the brain, cognition, and intelligence.

Given the rapid developments in the fields of machine learning and cognitive neuroscience, driven by technological advancements and increasing computing power, I see a lot of potential in the fusion of both fields to drive new scientific discoveries in terms of human/natural cognition as well as artificial intelligence.

Before moving to Tübingen, I have spent three years in the beautiful city of Maastricht, The Netherlands where I have completed the Bachelor's program in psychology with a focus on cognitive neuroscience at the [Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-psychology-and-neuroscience) of Maastricht University.
