### R: a language for statistical computing & graphics

***
Sadly, all of my statistics courses so far have been taught only using [**IBM SPSS**](https://www.ibm.com/de-de/analytics/spss-statistics-software). I have heard of the [**R language**](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) before and I have noticed that a lot of statistics classes make use of it instead of SPSS or [**SAS/STAT**](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/stat.html), which is why I have been interested in learning more about R for quite some time now.

A lot of people told me that learning about R is not really necessary, as there exist libraries in python for pretty much all the things you can do with R. Even though this might be true, I still would like to experience the differences for myself. Also R is still a widely-used language in the field of data science and statistics so I believe (and hope) it will not be a complete waste of time.

I'm currently reading the book [**_"Hands-on programming with R"_**](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by _Garrett Grolemund_ which, in my opinion, gives a pretty good first introduction to R. It is the 'little brother' of [**_'R for Data Science'_**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) by _Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham_ which I'm planning to read next.

Below, I will link some **R Notebooks** which summarize the content of the book and which will most likely serve as quick reference for me in the future.

## Hands-on programming with R: Summaries:

- [**Chapter 01**](\blog\r-html\Hands-on-R-01.html): Primitive objects, Functions

- [**Chapter 02**](\blog\r-html\Hands-on-R-02.html): Packages, ggplot2, qplot

- [**Chapter 03**](\blog\r-html\Hands-on-R-03.html): Basic types, attributes, classes, matrices, arrays, factors, coercion, lists, data frames

- [**Chapter 04**](\blog\r-html\Hands-on-R-04.html): Indexing/selecting, conditional selection, dollar sign
